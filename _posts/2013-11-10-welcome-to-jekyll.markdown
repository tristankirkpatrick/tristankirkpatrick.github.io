I wanted to streamline the process of adding blog posts and bits I find on the web. Jekyll seems like an excellent way to post from my computer. See the information below, maybe you will find it useful.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
